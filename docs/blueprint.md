# **App Name**: College Notifier

## Core Features:

- Notice Blocks: Display notices in four blocks: Text, PDF, Image, and Video.
- Moving Bulletin: Implement a horizontal moving bulletin at the bottom of the page for important announcements.
- Date/Time Display: Display the date and time of each notice.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light grey (#F5F5F5) for a clean background.
- Secondary color: White (#FFFFFF) for content blocks to provide contrast.
- Accent: Teal (#008080) for headings, links, and the moving bulletin to draw attention.
- Use a grid-based layout to arrange the notice blocks in a structured manner.
- Ensure all text is easily readable with sufficient contrast against background colors.
- Smooth transitions and animations for the moving bulletin to catch the user's eye.
